        <p>Binary is a base 2 system which allows you to input possible values, 1s and 0s, that a computer can recognize as off and on. This system allows you to communicate with your computer by simply translating your values into its language. In a decimal number system, each decimal place represents a power of 10. The difference between that and binary is that each place in binary code only represents a power of 2. With this website, you are able to easily translate your decimal number into a figure that's easily readable and accessible by your computer!</p>
        <article>Hexadecimal numbers</article>
        <p>Hexadecimal is another number system that is this time a base 16 system. The system uses the numbers 0-9 and then A-F. In modern computers, a hexadecimal value can be an easier way to express binary numbers! HExadecimal is easier and more efficient because you can keep your text much shorter- it only takes one hexdecimal digit to represent four binary digits. The only downside to this system is that it can be hard for some to convert decimals and binary code to this format! Luckily, this website makes it easy and efficient!</p>
